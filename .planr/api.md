### API Design for AI Image Generation App

The following API design outlines the endpoints required for the AI Image Generation App, a minimal web-based application that enables casual users to generate images from text prompts using the fal.ai API's Flux-schnell model. The design aligns with the Product Requirements Document (PRD) provided, targeting a launch date of March 27, 2025. Below is the detailed schema, including endpoint definitions, request/response formats, and role-based access considerations.

- ID: API-01
- Title: Generate Image
- Method: POST
- Path: /api/generate-image
- Description: Allows users to submit a text prompt to generate an image via the fal.ai API's Flux-schnell model. The endpoint handles the request server-side, returning the generated image URL or an error message based on validation and API response.

      ```json
      {
        "error": "Daily budget exceeded, service unavailable."
      }
      ```
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 500
    - Description: Internal server error or unexpected fal.ai API failure (e.g., network issues).
    - Content:

      }
      ```

#### Endpoint: API-02
- ID: API-02
- Title: Check Service Status
- Method: GET
- Path: /api/status
- Description: Returns the current availability of the image generation service, including budget and rate limit status, without interacting with fal.ai unless necessary. Helps users avoid unnecessary requests.
- RequiredRoles:
  - Guest: Accessible to all users without authentication, as specified in the PRD for public access with no user identification required.

- RequestBody:
  - Schema: None

- Responses:
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 200
    - Description: Service is available.
    - Content: 
      ```json
      {
        "status": "available",
        "message": "Service is operational."
      }
      ```
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 402
    - Description: Daily budget exceeded.
    - Content:
      ```json
      {
        "status": "unavailable",
        "message": "Daily budget exceeded, service unavailable."
      }
      ```
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 429
    - Description: Rate limit active (local or fal.ai).
    - Content:
      ```json
      {
        "status": "limited",
        "message": "Rate limit reached, please try again later."
      }
      ```

---

#### Endpoint: API-03
- ID: API-03
- Title: Check Rate Limit
- Method: GET
- Path: /api/rate-limit
- Description: Returns the current rate limit status for the requesting IP or session, indicating how many requests remain within a specified time window (e.g., per minute or hour). Helps prevent abuse by allowing users to self-regulate and informs them of local limits beyond fal.ai constraints.
- RequiredRoles:
  - Guest: Accessible to all users without authentication, as specified in the PRD for public access with no user identification required.

- RequestBody:
  - Schema: None

- Responses:
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 200
    - Description: Rate limit status returned successfully.
    - Content: 
      ```json
      {
        "requests_made": 5,       // Number of requests made in the current window
        "requests_limit": 10,     // Maximum allowed requests per window (e.g., per minute)
        "window_reset": 60        // Seconds until the rate limit window resets
      }
      ```
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 429
    - Description: Rate limit exceeded for this IP or session.
    - Content:
      ```json
      {
        "error": "Too many requests, please wait and try again.",
        "requests_made": 10,
        "requests_limit": 10,
        "window_reset": 45
      }
      ```
  - Response:
    - StatusCode: 500
    - Description: Server error while retrieving rate limit data.
    - Content:
      ```json
      {
        "error": "An error occurred while checking rate limit status."
      }
      ```

### Review of API Schema

- Completeness: The endpoints address all backend-related requirements from the PRD and add proactive abuse prevention with API-03. API-02 enhances user experience by providing service status.
- Consistency: The design maintains a uniform JSON response structure: "image_url" or status fields for success, "error" for failures. Status codes follow HTTP standards (200 for success, 400 for client errors, 429 for rate limits, 402 for budget issues, 500 for server errors).
- Traceability: Each endpoint and response is designed to fulfill the requirements in the PRD.

---

### Notes on Design Choices

- Multiple Endpoints: API-01 remains the core functionality, while API-02 and API-03 add optional but recommended features for user experience and abuse prevention. This balances the app's minimal design with practical safeguards.
- Role-Based Access: Limited to "Guest" role across all endpoints, consistent with the PRD's no-authentication requirement.
- Rate Limiting as Endpoint: API-03 provides transparency into local rate limits (e.g., 10 requests per minute per IP), complementing fal.ai's limits and reducing abuse potential without requiring middleware complexity.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive responses cover PRD scenarios plus additional abuse-related cases (e.g., local rate limits in API-03).
- Implementation: Use Vercel KV or an in-memory store for rate limit tracking in API-03, keeping it lightweight and serverless-compatible.

This API design is ready for implementation within the SvelteKit framework, leveraging serverless API routes on Vercel, with the `FAL_AI_API_KEY` securely stored in environment variables as per the tech stack summary.
