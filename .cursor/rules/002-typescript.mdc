# TypeScript Standards

## Type Definitions
- Create dedicated type files for complex shared types
- Use interfaces for object shapes that might be extended
- Use type for unions, intersections, and utility types
- Prefer explicit return types for functions
- Make use of TypeScript's utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit

## Functions and Methods
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors
- Apply function overloading for functions with multiple signatures
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Document complex functions with JSDoc comments

## Module Structure
- Follow single responsibility principle for modules
- Use named exports for better tree-shaking
- Group related functionality within a single module
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules
- Import only what is needed from external libraries
