# Svelte Component Standards

## Script Organization
- Place imports at the top of the script block
- Define component props immediately after imports
- Order script contents: imports, props, reactive declarations, lifecycle functions, other methods
- Use $: for reactive declarations
- Organize component exports at the end of script block

## Template Structure
- Keep template markup semantic and accessible
- Use {#if}, {#each}, and {#await} blocks for conditional rendering and iteration
- Implement keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Add proper labels and descriptions to form elements
- Maintain a clean hierarchy of elements without excessive nesting

## Styling Practices
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes when possible
- For component-specific styles, use the style block with scoped attribute
- Define CSS variables at the highest appropriate level
- Implement responsive design using TailwindCSS breakpoints
- Avoid using !important in styles
