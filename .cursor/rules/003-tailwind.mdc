# TailwindCSS Standards

## Class Organization
- Group related utility classes together by category
- Order classes logically: layout, sizing, spacing, typography, colors, effects
- Use arbitrary value syntax with square brackets when needed
- Extract repeated class patterns into @apply directives in a style block
- Prefer native Tailwind utilities over custom CSS when possible

## Responsive Design
- Use mobile-first approach with responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Apply consistent breakpoints throughout the application
- Test layouts across all defined breakpoint ranges
- Use flex and grid utilities for responsive layouts
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant when applicable

## Configuration
- Extend the theme in tailwind.config.js rather than using arbitrary values
- Define custom colors, spacing, and other theme values in the configuration
- Create reusable component classes with @apply in a separate CSS file
- Use plugins for common patterns rather than recreating utilities
- Purge unused styles in production builds
